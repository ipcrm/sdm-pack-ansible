# @ipcrm/sdm-pack-ansible

Using this pack you can schedule Ansible goals in the SDM.  This can be used with Ansible Engine, for either playbooks or adhoc commands.

Example adhoc:
```typescript
    const ansible = new AnsibleEngine()
        .with({
            args: ["-m", "ping", "localhost"],
        });
```

Example Plabook execution:
```typescript
    const ansiblePlaybook = new AnsibleEngine()
        .with({
            playbook: "test.yaml",
        });
```

See the type docs for details on how to customize the `AnsibleEngine` goal.
